These scripts are for GreenGenes version gg_2011_1.

They may not work with different versions of GreenGenes if the
file format changed.

These scripts will generate 3 files to be used with Ray Communities:

- TreeOfLife-Edges.tsv  (each line has: parent	child)
- Taxon-Names.tsv       (each line has: identifier	taxon name	rank)
- Genome-to-Taxon.tsv (each line has: GenBank identifier	taxon identifier)


The entry point is main.sh

This script may not work correclty when downloading files from Amazon EC2 because
GreenGenes are protected with:

- an expiry date;
- a Amazon Web Services key;
- a signature.


Also, the code that generates gi_to_accession.txt  needs access to all reference
genomes in NCBI, see main.sh
