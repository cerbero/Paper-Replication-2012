This is the code used to validate the correctness of contigs
generated with Ray Meta. The simulated sample with 100 bacterial genomes
was used here.

Upstream products are /rap/nne-790-ab/projects/Meta-simulation/Sample-100.dir/Ray-100.2012-05-26/Assembly/{Contigs,Scaffolds}.fasta


Scripts to validate assemblies were fetched from the project Ray-TestSuite/ at https://github.com/sebhtml/Ray-TestSuite
