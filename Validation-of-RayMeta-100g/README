This is the code used to validate the correctness of contigs
generated with Ray Meta. The simulated sample with 100 bacterial genomes
(or 1000 genomes) was used here.


Basically, the script uses MUMmer (nucmer) and script to parse and analyze
MUMmer files.



Upstream products are /rap/nne-790-ab/projects/Meta-simulation/Sample-100.dir/Ray-100.2012-05-26/Assembly/{Contigs,Scaffolds}.fasta


These scripts to validate assemblies were fetched from the project Ray-TestSuite/
at https://github.com/sebhtml/Ray-TestSuite
